abstract: "A unified theoretical framework proposing that all physical phenomena emerge from quantum fluctuations governed by universal correlation effects. The Nq axiom Var(Ô) = ℏω(1+C)/N unifies quantum mechanics, general relativity, and the Standard Model through the correlation parameter C. The theory provides practical solutions to major physics problems including quantum gravity, gravitational constant dynamics, Standard Model origins, and cosmological tensions while offering specific experimental predictions and computational implementation methods."
